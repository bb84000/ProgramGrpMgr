Program group manager for Windows

You have too many shortcuts on Windows 10 desktop ? Program group manager is for you.

Each instance of Program Group Manager is a small "sub-desktop" which can contain several applications you can runb exactly as if they were on the desktop. Each "sub-desktop" has its own shortcut, so you can reduce drastically the number of shortcut on your desktop.

Program Group Manager mimics the old Program Manager which was present in Windows 3.1 several decades ago.

This is a rewrite of old progman with 32bit and 64bit versions.

Compiled with Free Pascal - Lazarus
